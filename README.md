# Paddock Profiles F1 - Chrome Extension

## Overview

Paddock Profiles F1 is a lightweight Chrome extension that enhances your web browsing experience by identifying Formula 1 driver names (past and present) within webpage text. It highlights these names (by making them bolder and changing their color) and displays a tooltip on hover, showing key career statistics.

Clicking the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar shows a small popup indicating the extension is active.

This extension is built using TypeScript and adheres to Chrome's Manifest V3 standards.

## Features

*   **Driver Name Highlighting:** Attempts to detect and highlight F1 driver names found in the text content of web pages. Highlighted names are made bolder and their color is changed.
*   **Contextual Tooltips:** Hovering over a highlighted name reveals a tooltip with essential driver information:
    *   Current/Last Team
    *   Total Grand Prix Wins
    *   World Championships Won
    *   Career Span (Years Active)
*   **Static Data:** Uses a bundled JSON file (`public/driver_data.json`) for quick access to driver stats.
*   **Browser Action Popup:** Clicking the extension icon displays a popup confirming the extension is active.
*   **CSS Styling:** Basic custom styling for highlights and tooltips is provided in `public/content.css`.
*   **Manifest V3 Compliant:** Built following the latest Chrome extension guidelines.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** For type safety and improved maintainability.
*   **HTML/CSS:** For the browser action popup and styling of highlights/tooltips.
*   **Chrome Extension APIs (Manifest V3):** `scripting`, `activeTab`, `runtime.getURL`, `action`, DOM manipulation APIs.

## File Structure

*   `manifest.json`: Core extension configuration.
*   `package.json`: Project dependencies and build scripts.
*   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration.
*   `src/content.ts`: Main script for DOM manipulation, highlighting, and tooltips.
*   `public/driver_data.json`: Static data for F1 drivers.
*   `public/content.css`: Styles for highlighted text and tooltips.
*   `public/popup.html`: HTML for the browser action popup.
*   `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript output (generated by build process).
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `README.md`: This file.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional, if you have the files already, skip):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/muochu/PaddockProfiles.git
    cd PaddockProfiles
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, in the project root directory:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Build the Extension:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command compiles `src/content.ts` into `dist/content.js`.

4.  **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
    *   Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
    *   Enable **Developer mode** (toggle switch, usually in the top-right corner).
    *   Click the **Load unpacked** button.
    *   In the file dialog, select the **entire project directory** (e.g., `PaddockProfiles`).
    *   The "F1 Driver Context" extension card should appear.

## How to Use

1.  Once installed and enabled, click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar. A small popup should appear saying "Active".
2.  Navigate to any webpage containing text about Formula 1.
3.  The extension will attempt to scan the page content. Recognized F1 driver names (from `public/driver_data.json`) should be highlighted (text becomes bolder and changes color).
4.  Hover your mouse cursor over any highlighted name.
5.  A tooltip should appear near the cursor displaying the driver's stats.

## Data Source (`public/driver_data.json`)

The driver statistics are stored in `public/driver_data.json`. You can edit this file to add more drivers or update stats. Remember to:
1.  Follow the existing JSON format (double-quoted keys and string values).
2.  Re-build the extension (`npm run build`).
3.  Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/` (click the refresh icon on the extension card, or disable/enable it).

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

If names are not highlighting:
1.  Ensure you have run `npm run build` after any code changes.
2.  Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  Open the target webpage and refresh it (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R).
4.  Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check the **Console** tab for error messages or logs starting with "F1 Driver Context:". These logs are crucial for diagnosing issues.

## Future Improvements

*   More robust name matching for different formats and languages.
*   Handling of dynamically loaded content (e.g., infinite scroll).
*   Fetching data from a live external API.
*   User options for customizing appearance or functionality.
